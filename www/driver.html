          Volunteer computing applications generally run when the PC owner is
          away from his desk and the machine is idle. We believe that a higher
          efficiency, in terms of computation performed per unit of energy
          consumed, when the computation is executed when the user is working on
          the machine. After all, even when you are working intensively, the
          usage of the CPU rarely goes over 20% of its capacities.
        </p>

        <p>
          To run the computation in the background, a number of
          precautions have to be taken, though. In particular, the
          BOINC application must avoid putting the machine in a
          high-performance mode. Because the application is
          CPU-intensive, a high-performance mode is normally a good
          idea if you ignore the energy consumption.  The performance
          mode of your machine is selected by the operating
          system. Unfortunately, there currently exists no means for
          an application to dictate its CPU performance mode. So that
          is why we investigated in ways to work around this. 
        </p>


        <p>
        We developed a Windows driver to help monitor and control the
        energy consumption of Desktop Grids. The role of the driver is
        twofold: To obtain detailed information about the CPU's
        performance states (P-state) on Windows, To give individual
        application control over the CPU's P-state when they are
        executing.  The active P-state is normally managed by the
        operating system. Using this driver, applications can by-pass
        the OS and can talk to the CPU's P-state mechanism directly.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="driver.png" width="200px" /></p>

        <p>
          To communicate the requested P-state to the CPU requires
          writing hardware specific bit patterns to special
          addresses. The information about these addresses, the bit
          patterns, and which method to use to read/write the data is
          extracted from the hardware description provided by the ACPI
          sub-system.
        </p>

        <p>
          The development of the Windows driver is severely hampered
          by the lack of Microsoft's documentation on its ACPI
          interface, the appropriate position where to insert the
          driver into the Windows driver stack, and the Windows kernel
          API in general. After much effort, we managed to develop a
          driver that inserts itself on top of the CPU driver. This
          allows the driver to obtain the required information from
          the ACPI sub-system.
        </p>

        <p>
          The driver further creates a special file handle through
          which user-space applications can communicate. The driver
          also creates a kernel thread that periodically attaches to
          each CPU in the system. For each CPU, it collects data about
          the current values of the P-state. Applications can read the
          statistics gathered by the driver. This information is
          formatted similarly to the data obtained on the Linux
          kernel: the amount of time each CPU has spent in each
          P-state since the start of the system. Applications can also
          request the driver to maintain the P-state of a specific CPU
          at a specific value. The driver will then periodically check
          the current P-state and override any values that do not
          correspond to the requested value. Because the update period
          of the driver is higher than that of the Windows OS, the
          performance state can is nearly continuously kept at the
          requested value.
        </p>

        <p>
          The installation of the driver requires administrator
          privileges on the target machine.
        </p>

        <p>
          A compact user-space application has been developed to
          interact with the driver. The API is as follows:
        </p>

          <div class="api_fun">LPCInterface* LPCInterfaceNew();</div>
