        <p>
          We developed a BOINC application that gathers data from participating
          machines. When a volunteer registers to the low-energy BOINC project
          (not yet possible at the time of writing), a non-cpu-intensive BOINC
          application is downloaded and run on the volunteers PC. This
          application gathers information about the performance, the energy use,
          and the environment and uploads it to the server.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below you can get an idea of how the pieces fit
          together. All the data is uploaded
          to <a href="OpenSensorData.net">OpenSensorData.net</a>, but
          can be viewed online on this site in your account section.

            <td>The CPU can be in one of several performance states (P-state). With each P-state is associated a different clock-frequency (and voltage) but also a different power consumption. It is therefore an important to trace the active P-state to evaluate the performance/energy ratio of a machine.</td>

            <td>The CPU load indicates the percentage of time that the CPU is running processes. All activities are accounted for, including system services, BOINC processes, and user applications.  Inversely, it allows measuring the percentage of time that the machine is idle.</td>

            <td class="bold">User absent or not</td>

          <tr>
            <td class="bold">Fan speed</td>
            <td>The fan speed gives us a further indication of how intensively a machine is used. It also gives feedback on whether the machine has entered a regime in which a high CPU becomes disturbing for the user.</td>
