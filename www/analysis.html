          The goal of this project is to evaluate how much energy is
          consumed by DG, and how this compares to the energy consumed
          by more conventional solutions, such as computing clusters
          and cloud computing. The general understanding is that DG
          requires less energy than the other solution but we lack
          real figures to validate this hypothesis. With this work we
          want to remedy this shortcoming. In addition, it can provide
          valuable information about we can further reduce the energy
          of DG solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first reaction would be to simply measure how much
          energy a system consumes. However, we have also to take into
          account how much computing it performs. So it seems more
          appropriate to look at the amount of computation performed
          PER unit of energy that goes into the system, or the
          Performance/Watt.
        </p>

        <p>
          The performance of a system roughly means the speed of
          computation of the machine. The performance is, in itself, a
          flexible concept, but we will make the following
          assumptions:

          <ul>
            <li>We deal with scientific computing applications that
            are CPU bound. In this case the classical measures
            (Whetstone, CPU2006, or LINPACK) may be sufficient.</li>

            <li>We perform "embarrassingly parallel" problems. All
            tasks are computed independently. We therefore assume that
            the performance of the DG/cluster is the sum of the
            performance of the PCs/nodes.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          The Performance/Watt thus seems a good measure to evaluate a
          system. However, computers in a DG are "time-sharing"
          systems: the machine is used both for the scientific
          computation and for its "regular" use, for example, office
          applications or web services. We should therefore be more
          precise in how we compute the energy consumption of the
          machine since part of the consumption is due to the other
          uses. 
        </p>

        <p>
          There are three canonical situations:
          <ul>
            <li>The machine is turned to only to run DG
              applications. In this case 100% of the energy used by
              the machine will be accounted for.</li>

            <li>The machine periodically runs DG applications, when
              the machine is considered idle. When the machine is used for
              other purposes, no DG applications run. For example, it is
              possible to configure BOINC such that it only runs
              computations when the user is absent at the night. In this
              case only the energy during the periods when the scientific
              applications run should be taken into account.</li>

            <li>The scientific computation takes places concurrently
              with other activities. In this case, we must separate the
              energy used by the DG from the energy required to run the
              other activities.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
          In the first and the second case, the energy consumption and
          computing efficiency are more easy to define. In the last
          case, this is less straightforward because we need more
          detailed info about how the resources are charged between
          the tasks. It requires a fine-grained monitoring.
        </p>

        <p>
          What we have to do is estimate the "DG-Power" requirements
          and the "DG-Performance" of the machine. The DG-Power is the
          amount of energy put into the system to run the Desktop Grid
          applications. Similarly, the DG-Performance is the basically
          the speed of computation of the DG applications. Once we
          have these numbers we can compute the Performance-per-Watt =
          DG-Performance / DG-Power.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the case that the machine runs BOINC apps 100% of the
          time at 100% of the CPU capacity, DG-Performance / DG-Power
          = Machine-Performance / Machine-Power.  This is true also
          when the machine runs the computation intermittently, but
          has all the resources when it does.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the third scenario mentioned above (when the machine is
          simultaneously used for other purposes) we have to split of
          the energy used for these activities, from the energy used
          for the computation. In many cases, the other activities
          (such as the owner doing office work) does not stress the
          computer very much and its energy consumption is close to a
          stable minimum energy level. However, when the computation
          is thrown into the mix, this energy consumption will go up
          because more resources (CPU, memory) are used. It is this
          extra energy that we should measure and use to evaluate the
          power consumption of the Desktop Grid. The energy monitor
          described in the previous section therefore measures the CPU
          load of the user and DG applications in combination with the
          instantaneous power consumption. From this data, we estimate
          the base-line energy consumption of the machine, and the
          extra energy consumption, the DG-Energy , due to the
          computation. We also measure the progress of the running
          BOINC applications to estimate the DG-Performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also assume that there are four broad classes of machines
          that participate in DG: servers, personal desktops,
          personal laptops, private desktops. We will have to evaluate
          how they map to the three simple use cases discussed above.
        </p>

        <p>
          The analysis of the information gathered by the energy
          monitor will help us detect stereotypical situations. For
          each situation we will analyse what the performance per Watt
          is, and what can be done to decrease the energy
          requirements. This will lead to a set of profiles that can
          be used to configure BOINC and the machine.
